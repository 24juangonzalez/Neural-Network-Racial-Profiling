# Neural-Network-Racial-Profiling
For my graduate machine learning class, I created a neural network that makes predictions based off of the Austin Police Department's Racial Profiling dataset for 2019.


To run this program, install necessary libraries in a virtual env. I recommend using Spyder as this was built in Spyder. Accuracy report may be off the first time being ran, but accuracy for the neural net is 65%.
Can be used with other datasets, depending on variables being used/omitted/combined.
